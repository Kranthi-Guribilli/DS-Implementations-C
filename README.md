# Implementation of Data Structures using C:
# About: ðŸš€
* This repository contains implementation of data structures in C
* Each data structure has it's own seperate README with related explanations and links for further reading.<br>


# Data Structures:
<p>A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.</p>
