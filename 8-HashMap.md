# HashMap:

* Hash Function:
  ```
  A function that converts a given big phone number to a small practical integer value. The mapped integer value is used as an index in hash table. In simple terms, a hash      function maps a big number or string to a small integer that can be used as index in hash table. 
 A good hash function should have following properties 
   1) Efficiently computable. 
   2) Should uniformly distribute the keys (Each table position equally likely for each key) 
  ```
